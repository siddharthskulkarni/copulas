            <li>Copulas are useful in modelling joint distributions(multivariate distributions) based on known marginals
                and dependence structure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the joint distribution is obtained, the probabilities of a set of random variables being in certain
                regions
                conditioned on others being in certain regions can also be computed.
            </li>
            <li>In terms of domains, copulas are useful across quantitative finance and economics, medicine, hydrology
                to
                name a few.
            </li>
            <li>Choosing a particular copula family depends on the desired dependence properties for the particular
                dependence being modelled. Crossing the major hurdle of choosing a copula family, the parameters
                of the copula can be estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation techniques with available data.
