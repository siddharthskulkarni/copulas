            <li>A common method for constructing copulas is known as the inversion method. Manipulating the definition
                of a coupla,
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                F_{X, Y}(x, y) &= C_{X, Y}(F_X(x),F_Y(y)) \\
                \implies C_{X, Y}(x, y) &= F_{X, Y}(F_X^{(-1)}(x), F_Y^{(-1)}(y)) \tag{3.1}
                \end{align*}
                \]
                Then,
                \[\begin{align*}
                {F'}_{X, Y}(x, y) &= C_{X, Y}({F'}_X(x), {F'}_Y(y)) \tag{3.2} \\
                \end{align*}\]

                (3.1) implies that a known joint distribution with known marginal distributions can be used to obtain a
                copula.
                Having the copula, (3.2) gives a way of obtaining different joint distributions with arbitrary
                marginals.
