            <li>A copula is a function, with the marginal distributions of random variables as its
                inputs, and joint distribution of the random variables as its output.

            <li>Given a set of random variables with known marginal distributions, a copula can be
                used to model their joint distribution.

            \(\textbf{\textit{Def 1.1 (Copula): }}\) Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two random variables with
            marginal distributions \(F_X\) and \(F_Y\), and joint distribution \(F_{X, Y}\).
            Then
            the copula of \(X\) and \(Y\) is a function
            \(C_{X, Y}: [0, 1]^2 \to [0, 1]\) such that \[F_{X, Y}(x, y) = C_{X, Y}(F_X(x),
            F_Y(y))\text{.}\]
